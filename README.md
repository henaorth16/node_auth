## SIMPLE NODE JS AUTH

This project shows how authentication is done in node js with jwt (json web token)

To set up this project run the following command on the terminal

```bash
   npm i express mongoose ejs jwt
```

If you haven't installed `nodemon` before install it using the following command

```bash
   npm i nodemon -g
```

Just have fun with this project :grin:
